# Groundskeeper-Willie
An open-source automated tool that cleans up a given cloud subscription/resources when given expiration criteria.

## Further Information
Groundskeeper-Willie is a project for my Production Project Module at Leeds Beckett University. It is part of my final year
of my Computer Science Degree. <br>

It aims to test whether the management of an Azure Cloud resource, handled by this tool alone, is feasible.
This is done with the help of Azure tags and CRON jobs - the idea being Groundskeeper is run daily.

## Who Is Groundskeeper For?
Groundskeeper is being designed for everyone. This included large businesses that contain multiple Azure subscriptions
that each contain lots of resources, and for the smaller businesses/passion developers who may only have a smaller
footprint in the cloud.<br>

As this is my project for university, I will be able to post my accompanying documents
and reports on my findings after I graduate.
